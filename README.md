# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:

This app prints a random affirmative message from a list of possible messages. Users can choose between affirmations and mantras. Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth. Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices.

This is a learning project from Turing School Module 1. The spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

When a user selects a message option and then clicks the “Receive Message” button, the user sees a random message from the list of possible messages for that category
- [x] When the message appears, the mediation icon disappears from the message area.

2. User never sees a repeated message (CYOA)
- [x] Use JavaScript to ensure that the user never sees a repeated message until they’ve seen them all.
- [x] After they’ve seen them all they should be notified that they will now start seeing repeat messages.
